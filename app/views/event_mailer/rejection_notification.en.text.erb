Hello,

We regret to inform you that, due to an overwhelming number of talk submissions and the time constraints, we were unable to include your submission for a <%= @event.event_type.name.mb_chars.downcase %> titled "<%= @event.title %>" in the main schedule.

However, we have an alternative option available for you. If you're interested, you can present a condensed, 5-minute version of your talk during our Lightning Talks slot at the event venue. You can sign up for Lightning Talks in person during the event.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to <%= @event.conference.title %> and hope to see you there!

Best regards,
<%= @event.conference.title %> Team
